# daak

In the Tausug language, daak means to command or order.  daak is a small pure python library that can execute a 
subprocess and grab the stdout and stderr asynchronously.

It has limited support for handling input, mostly for when a sudo password is expected.

## Installation

Through pip

```bash
pip install daak
```
